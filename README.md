# CSE676_MastersProject

This code was developed using Jupyter notebook. The images in the dataset are included in this repository. The code accesses the images from the working directory, so the images need to be in the working directory when this code is run. They should NOT be in a folder in the working directory.  
* Structure should look like this:  
    * workingDirectory/CSE676_Project.ipynb 
    * workingDirectory/img_0.png  
    * workingDirectory/img_1.png  
    * ...  
    * workingDirectory/img_418.png  
 
Once the directory structure is correct, the code should compile correctly. To replicate the different models and associated databases, comments are include in the code blocks on what to change/uncomment and the correct configuration for the different models.
